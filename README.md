# DailyDevo

Project Name : DailyDevo

Application Description: As a christian, one of the most disciplinary and difficult tasks to do daily is devotionals. Devotionals are basically personal bible study sessions that people do on their own. However, it is super easy for christians to fall behind and forget about them. This application approaches this issue by creating a place where other christians are able to come together to do devotionals together and keep each other accountable. We give them a platform where they can chat and share what they've read and learned as well as create a plan for themselves to follow.

Features + Tools/Technologies: API: We would create our own API that would keep track of chat history of peoples conversations as well as devotional discussions. Chatting: We would allow users to discuss and communicate with multiple people at once. We will need to use the API to keep track of the chat history. We would also have to have a function where people can upload photos as well as a calendar for planning.

Timeline: April 24: Implement API for chatting April 26: Create the HUD for the chatting box April 28: Create the interface of having open discussions with multiple people at a time April 30: implement the function of actually seeing and creating new discussions and saving chat history

Wilson Fung and I will complete the work together in person
